# chat42app

This is a react native client for [chat42](https://github.com/replikativ/chat42).

## Usage

It follows
the [re-natal reframe template](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal). You
have to run a chat42 server as a relay to other peers. The server IP is
currently hardcoded for the android emulator. No iOS version is available yet
due to the lack of a Mac.
